       <t>
              This document specifies a YANG module for configuring and
           monitoring the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP)  <xref target="RFC7854"/>.  The model
           provides parameters for defining the session to BMP monitoring stations; the
           selection of the BGP Routing Information Bases (RIBs) for Route Monitoring Messages; provides
           operational metrics and enables reseting of BMP monitoring sessions.
       </t> 

       <t>The BMP yang model is placed at the root of the YANG tree.  At its
           upper level, the BMP model lists each monitoring station. Every
           monitoring station is identified by an ID, which is a string
           provided by the operator.</t>

       <t>We describe the configuration of the monitoring station in the next sections.</t>

    <section title="IP Connectivity" anchor="ip_connectivitu">
        <t> BMP allows for active and passive
            connections between the router and the BMP monitoring station as described in  <xref
                target="RFC7854" section="3.2" sectionFormat="of"/>. In
            an active connection, the router establishes the TCP connection to
            the monitoring station, while in a passive one, it is the monitoring
            station which initiates the connection. The BMP yang module
            provides options for both types of connection using a choice.</t>

        <t>We describe each type of connection option next, and provide
            examples of their configuration.</t>

    <section title="Active connection">

        <t>For an active connection, the IP address and port of the monitoring
            station, together with the local address MUST be provided. One can
            optionally provide the local port for establishing the connection.
            If the monitoring station is connected over a network-instance
            instead of the global one, this one must also be specified. An
            example of configuration is included in <xref target="active_connection_option"/>.</t>

        <section title="BMP route monitoring" anchor="route_monitoring">

        <t>Route monitoring messages are used for synchronization of RIBs to the monitoring station. See <xref target="RFC7854" section="5" sectionFormat="of"/>.</t>

        <t>The next 3 requirements were defined before designing this part of the model.</t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>Operators might not want to receive all routes from all RIBs in a network device. For instance, some devices contain a considerable amount of data that might overwhelm the monitoring station. In this cases, operators might want to only collect information from an arbitrary subset of RIBs, address families, peers.</li>
            <li>Operators might want to configure the route monitoring messages for different network instances differently. For example, they might want to receive different address families from the global network instance than in L3 VPN network instances. </li>
            <li>In contrast to the previous points. some opetarors might want a simple configuration that covers multiple cases (e.g. same config for all peers, or same config for all network instances).  This would not only make configuartions look smaller and concise, but will reduce the need for reconfiguring devices when you add a new peer or add a new network instance (which happens frequently on some type of networks). </li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>Based on the previous points, the BMP yang model is designed to flexibly control the data sent through the BMP route monitoring packets, yet it provides options to facilitate configurations for simple cases, such as when the operator wants to receive all routes from a RIB.</t>

      <t>The Routing monitoring configuration is divided in a 4 part hierarchy:</t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>Network Instance </li>
            <li>RIB Type (e.g. Adj-RIB-IN pre/post, local RIB)</li>
            <li>Address Family </li>
            <li>Peers</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>Abscense of the routing routing monitoring container will disable the routing monitoring messages to the monitoring station.</t>

      <t>We'll offer an introduction to these hierarchies before going over them with detail.</t>

      <t>The RIB types (e.g. Adj-RIB-IN, etc/OUT and local RIB) and Address families the number of types is low, and their configuration should not change frequenlty. Therefore, they are configured explicitly in the model. That is, the model does not provide a way of providing a default configuration for these or configuring them in groups.</t>

      <t>On the other hand, Network instaces and peers require greater flexibility.</t>

      <t>For network instances, the model should configure not only the "global" network instance (the main one configured under the /ietf-routing:routing), but also other network instances configured under the /ietf-network-instance:network-instances/. Also, network instances can change frequently in networks with customer connecting to Virtual Private Networks. To not force operators to change configuration at every change, the model provides methods for  defining a "default" configuration for network instances. However, to provide control over the configuration, each network instance can be configured independently, if needed.</t>

      <t>A situation is similar with peers. The model includes a way of configuring a default for all peers for simple cases, but one can provide configuration for type of peers or each peer individually. </t>

      <t>We summarize the requirements stated on the previous two paragraphs next:</t>

      <t>For network instances:</t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
          <li>The configuration should be simple for cases where only the "global" routing instance is enabled.</li>
          <li>The model should  provide ways of configuring all Netwrok instances (kind of a default config for any Network instance that is configured in the device).</li>
          <li>The model should provide a way of configuring network instances individually.</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>For peers:</t>
      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>The model should provide ways of configuring all peers, kind of a default. This would be the most common case.</li>
            <li>The model should provide ways of configuring type of peers. For instance, only send routes from ebgp peers.</li>
            <li>The model should provide ways of configuring individual peers. For instance, turn a route-policy filtering prefix for a specific peer, or turning off a peer that is noisy yet not important.</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>To further control the route monitoring data, the peer/peer-type container includes a route-policy option in which the operator can further filter the data send to the BMP monitoring station.</t>

      <t>We'll describe each of the 4 hierarchies, and provide examples for each, in the next sections.</t>

      <section title="Network instances">

          <t>The routing monitoring configuration starts with the selection of network instance. One or more Network instances can be selected using a "bmp-ni-types" identity, or they can be selected individually, referencing the /network-instance/ list.</t>

          <t>The model currently defines two bmp-ni-types identities: "bmp-ni-types-all-ni" which selects all network instances, and "bmp-ni-types-global-ni" which selects the global network instance (the one configured in `/ietf-routing:routing/`). The former can be used as a "default" configuration for simple cases.</t>

          <t>An empty configuration disables routing monitoring messages for the selected network-instances. Operators can also use the enable leaf to disable explicitly the routing messages for the network instance. </t>

          <t>The route-monitoring data for a network instance can be configured by maximum one element of the network-instances list.  There SHOULD  be clear rules to which element to apply to a network instance in case multiple elements can select it. We provide rules and examples in the next part of the section.</t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>If the bmp-ni-types-global-ni exist, the global network instance / network instance SHOULD be configured using this element.</li>
            <li>If any /ni:network-instances/ni:network-instance/ is referenced, the network instance SHOULD be configured using this element.</li>
            <li>Any Network instance not referenced by any rule above should be configured using the bmp-ni-types-all-ni if one exists. If it does not exist, then the network instance is not configured (and therefore no route monitoring messages from the network instance are sent to the monitoring station).</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>Any extension of the bmp-ni-types SHOULD provide explanations of how to deal with case in which multiple elements select the same network instance. </t>

      <t>We provide examples of configuring the network instance level next. To focus on the network instance configuration, we mask the configuration under each instance using "Configuration X". </t>

    <t>An empty configuration or absence of an address family disables route-messages for it. Operators can also disable the address-family route monitoring messages by marking the "enabled" leaf as False.</t>

    <t>We show a few examples of configuring RIB-Types and Address families next. We will mask further configurations of address families with "Configuration X" to focus on the covered parts.</t>

        <t>In <xref target='example_rib_af_one'/>,  we expand previous sections examples with RIB-Type and address families configurations. The expected result of the previous configuration would be:</t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>For the global network instance, adj-rib-in-pre and adj-rib-in-post RIBs are enabled. In each of them IPv4 and IPv6 address families are configured. The configuration can be the same or not, depending on the requirements of the operattors. Any other RIB and address famlies are disabled.</li>
            <li>Network instance one is disabled, meaning that routing monitoring messagages are disabled for that network instance.</li>
            <li>Network instance "network-instance-two" has adj-rib-out-post enabled, but only address family ipv4-unicast is configured. The ipv6-unicast will not be configured for this instance.</li>
            <li>For all other network intanaces, adj-rib-in-pre with ipv4 and ipv6 address families are configured, thanks to the configuration of bmp-ni-types-all-ni</li>
        </ul>
      </t>


      <t>If an operator only wants to configure the IPv4/IPv6 of adj-rib-pre-in for the global instance,  the configuration in <xref target='example_rib_af_one'/> will be enough.</t>

    <section title="Peers">

    <t>For adj-RIB-in and adj-RIB-out, both pre and post, the model requires the selection of peer's RIBs that will be transmitted to the monitoring station. The local-rib does not include this container.</t>

    <t>Peers are a list indexed by a peer id, which can be one of the following: </t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>An individual peer, using a remote address. The model currently does not check if the remote address exists, that would be a responsability of the device.</li>
            <li>A group of peers matching a BGP type. i.e. ebgp peers. </li>
            <li>One or more peers defined by an `bmp-peer-types` identity. The BMP model currently provides the `bmp-peer-types-all-peers` identity which select all peers. For simple cases, this is the value that would normally be considered.</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

    <t>Peers MUST be selected (configured) by maximum a single instance of the peers list. For the included keys in the BMP model, the process to select which instance to use is the next:</t>

      <t>
        <ul spacing="compact">
            <li>If there is a peer address matching the peer, it should be configured using that instance.</li>
            <li>If the peer is of any BGP type listed in the peer list, it should be configured using this instance.</li>
            <li>If there is a peer instance identified with the `bmp-peer-types-all-peers`, it would be configured using this instance.</li>
            <li>Finally, if no instance covers the peer, the data from this peer should not be transmited to the monitoring station.</li>
        </ul>
      </t>

      <t>An empty configuration of a peer type disables route-messages for it. Operators can also disable the address-family route monitoring messages by marking the "enabled" leaf as False.</t>

      <t>Any aditional bmp-peer-types identity created SHOULD describe how to unambiguoslly select a peer when there are conflicting options (multiple options covering the peer).</t>

      <t>We'll provide examples of the peers configuration after describing the filter containers.</t>

    </section>
    <section title="Filtering route-monitoring messages">

    <t>The local rib, and the peer containers within the rest of rib types, include a filter container. This container includes mechanims to filter route-monitoring messages for the specific RIB.</t>

    <t>The policy-filter can include a routing policy that, if existing, should be applied to the outgoing updates to the monitoring station, and would serve as a granular way of filtering the messages that the monitoring station receives. </t>

    <t>Note that the policy-filter contains an `accept-route` default export policy. An operator can change it to a reject-route, if required.</t>

    <t>The policies created with the routing-policy can perform a large variaty of actions routes, and can filter them based on multiple characteristics. For the consistency of the data in the monitoring station, The route policies actions SHOULD be restritcted to accepting or rejecting routes. Furthermore, the conditions SHOULD only match prefix sets.</t>

    <t>We present examples of full configurations next.</t>

      <t> 
         The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
          that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
          as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> or RESTCONF <xref
          target="RFC8040"/>. The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
          layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
          Shell (SSH) <xref target="RFC6242"/>. The lowest RESTCONF layer is
          HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS <xref
          target="RFC8446"/>. The NETCONF Access Control Model (NACM) <xref
              target="RFC8341"/> provides the means to restrict access for
          NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all
          available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and content. 
      </t>
      <t>
         BGP data is sensible for security considerations. The model described
          in this document could be used to send BGP information to malicious
          BMP stations. Write access to this model SHOULD therefore be
          properly protected. 
      </t>
      <t>
          The session-reset action can demand considerable amount of resources
          from network elements. It SHOULD thus be protected from illegal access.

            The configuration of route monitoring messages is more complex than

            of general identities of network instances and peers (e.g.
            bmp-ni-types-all-ni for NI, external for peers), and individual
